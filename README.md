# Building the gem

1. Ensure that you are running at least Ruby 1.9.3. RVM (https://rvm.io/) can be used to install different Ruby versions.

2. `./build.sh` will build the gem and place it into the `dist` directory. 

# RSpec Unit Tests

These confirm the proper behavior of the RSpec matcher module. These are located in the `spec` directory and may be run with `rspec spec`.
